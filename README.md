# A Simple Calculator Web App

The functionality of this calculator web application is based on the calculator located at this [website](https://www.online-calculator.com/full-screen-calculator/#). I understood that the action produced after a button is pressed depended on the previous button that was pressed and I used this to guide me through the process.

I used this project to utilise and improve on my logical thinking and problem solving skills. As this is my first personal project that uses mostly **JavaScript**, I got to learn a lot by doing and searching for help when needed. In addition to this, I also worked with **SASS** for the first time.
